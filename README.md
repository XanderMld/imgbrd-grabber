## About
Imgbrd-Grabber is an imageboard/booru downloader with graphical user interface. It can download thousands of images from multiple boorus automatically.
Its main advantage is its very powerful naming features: just set your filename and folder using all the tokens available and conditionals, and he will generate an image-dependant one.
